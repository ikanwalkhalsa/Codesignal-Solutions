Problem: Alternating Sum
Several people are standing in a row and need to be divided into two teams. The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1 again, the fourth into team 2, and so on.

You are given an array of positive integers - the weights of the people. Return an array of two integers, where the first element is the total weight of team 1, and the second element is the total weight of team 2 after the division is complete.

Example

For a = [50, 60, 60, 45, 70], the output should be
alternatingSums(a) = [180, 105].

Problem: Add Border
Given a rectangular matrix of characters, add a border of asterisks(*) to it.

Example

For

A non-empty array of non-empty equal-length strings.

Problem: Are Similar? 
Two arrays are called similar if one can be obtained from another by swapping at most one pair of elements in one of the arrays.

Given two arrays a and b, check whether they are similar.

Example

For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [1, 2, 3], the output should be
areSimilar(a, b) = true.

The arrays are equal, no need to swap any elements.

For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [2, 1, 3], the output should be
areSimilar(a, b) = true.

We can obtain b from a by swapping 2 and 1 in b.

For a = [1, 2, 2] and b = [2, 1, 1], the output should be
areSimilar(a, b) = false.

Any swap of any two elements either in a or in b won't make a and b equal.

[input] array.integer a

Array of integers.

Guaranteed constraints:
3 ≤ a.length ≤ 105,

[input] array.integer b

Array of integers of the same length as a.

Guaranteed constraints:
b.length = a.length,
1 ≤ b[i] ≤ 1000.

[output] boolean

true if a and b are similar, false otherwise.

Problem: Array change
You are given an array of integers. On each move you are allowed to increase exactly one of its element by one. Find the minimal number of moves required to obtain a strictly increasing sequence from the input.

Example

For inputArray = [1, 1, 1], the output should be

Problem: Palindrome Rearrange
